.. note:

   This is work in progress. 

Introduction
============

This Python packages aims at being the main entry point both for users and
developers of *foxBMS*. It provides a simple and easy-to-use graphical user
interface, written in *wxPython*, which walks you through the
configuration, build and flash process of the *foxBMS* ROM.


A first preview of the configure facilities is provided through the
``foxconfigure`` program that is available after installation of the
package.


Building the Package 
====================

Since the package will be distributed for the *foxConda* environment, it is
deployed as an Anaconda package. The according build recipe files are
located in the ``conda-recipe`` directory in the GIT root directory of the
package.

.. todo:

   - Currently only the POSIX build script is implemented.
   - Dependencies will have to be updated

To build the package, change into the respective local GIT working
directory and issue::

    python conda build conda-recipe

Afterward, the ready-built package is located in the platform ѕubdirectory
of the ``conda-bld`` directory of your *foxConda* installation. For
example::

    $USER/foxconda/conda-bld/osx-64/foxbms-0.1-py27_0.tar.bz2

The exact file path will be displayed at the end of the conda build step;
like so::

    # If you want to upload this package to anaconda.org later, type:
    #
    # $ anaconda upload $USER/foxconda/conda-bld/osx-64/foxbms-0.1-py 27_0.tar.bz2
    #
    # To have conda build upload to anaconda.org automatically, use
    # $ conda config --set anaconda_upload yes

.. important:

   Ignore the Anaconda upload instructions. At this point, we do not want
   to upload anything to any server!!!

   It is safe, however, to locally install the package.


To install it, simply run::

    $USER/foxconda/conda-bld/osx-64/foxbms-0.1-py27_0.tar.bz2
